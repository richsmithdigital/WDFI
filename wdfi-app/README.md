## Setting up authentication 

For this application to work you will need to ensure, one or more, authentication methods are set up. Click authentication from within your firebase application dash.

## Email & Google 

Enable Email & Google authentication, this is quick and easy and involves no external configuration.

To enable Facebook authentication you need to set up an external Facebook application. [I have provided a video on how to do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ztk1hKmcI0&t=17s), as the gogle documentation seemed patchy.
